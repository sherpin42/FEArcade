# FEArcade

FEArcade is a Frogger-style browser-based game created for the Udacity Front End Developer nano degree.

## Installation

There are no required installations - this will run in any modern browser with JavaScript enabled (which is the default setting).

## Usage

Move your player across the board using the up, down, left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. Avoid the bugs and make it up to the water at the top of the game board to win! 

If you collide with one of the bugs, the game will reset so you can try again.
