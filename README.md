- Double-click on the "index.html" file in your folder in order to open up the game in your favourite browser.

### Software requirements

This game will work in any modern browser with JavaScript enabled (which is the default setting). It is unlikely you will need to install anything to get it running.

## Usage

If you collide with one of the bugs, the game will reset so you can try again.
